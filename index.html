            Prashikshan Mitra is a revolutionary platform crafted to bridge the gap between students and educators by
            transforming how assignments and practical submissions are handled. In today’s fast-paced academic
            environment, managing submissions can be cumbersome for both teachers and students. Prashikshan Mitra offers
            a centralized solution, allowing students to upload their work effortlessly and enabling teachers to review,
            grade, and provide feedback efficiently.

            One of the standout features of Prashikshan Mitra is its real-time tracking system, which keeps both
            students and educators updated on the status of submissions. Teachers can view pending, submitted, and
            graded assignments at a glance, reducing administrative overhead and ensuring timely evaluations. Students
            benefit from notifications that remind them of upcoming deadlines, minimizing the chances of missed
            submissions. The platform also incorporates analytics tools, offering valuable insights into student
            performance over time, helping educators identify areas where students may need additional guidance.

            For teachers, the ability to provide personalized feedback directly on assignments is a game-changer.

            environments. For institutions already using other systems, Prashikshan Mitra offers seamless integration
            with existing learning management systems (LMS), enabling smooth adoption without disrupting established
            workflows.
